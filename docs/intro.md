# Tutorial Intro

# What is GitBuilding

GitBuilding is a program for documenting hardware. The goal of GitBuilding is to give you the freedom to write instructions in the form and structure that you want using markdown. Some extra syntax is added to generate the difficult things like bills of materials.

In GitBuilding you are able to:

* Write the instructions as you go along in markdown
* Tag links in the code with meta-data to show if they are steps in the build or parts that are needed
* Define a library including the part numbers for multiple suppliers
* Syntax for adding in bill of materials

**Note: While they work out the best syntax, major things might change!** If you have syntax suggestions please raise an issue!

To find out more [**visit their website**](https://gitbuilding.io/).

Tutorials are available only for Windows and GitHub users.

## How to install GitBuilding

To install (for Python 3.6+)

```bash
pip install gitbuilding
```
*Note: If you installed python from the Windows app store GitBuilding will not work as intended. If you are on windows you should install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). During install make sure you select the box to add python to your PATH*

Once the GitBuilding is a bit more stable they will add a simple way to install and run without using the command line.

### Windows

Open a Windows terminal and verify if Python is installed on your computer running `python --version`. Then, go to `C:\Users\username\` and write `pip install gitbuilding` to install GitBuilding. 

### Linux/UNIX
