## Previewing the website template

 GitBuilding has a built-in live editor. Open your terminal, navigate to the folder with your documentation, and run `gitbuilding serve`.

You can now open a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:6178/`. This will show the documentation in a browsable form.

 ## Continuous integration

 Once you have finished the first version of your documentation, it can be released on GitHub and keep working on it. To set up continuous integration run `gitbuilding generate ci` and follow the instructions to choose the hosting service you wish to use, in this case, GitHub. The current CI scripts assume that your documentation is in the root directory of your Git repository.
